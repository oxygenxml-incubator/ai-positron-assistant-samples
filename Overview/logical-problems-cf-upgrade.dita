                    <li id="li_nl5_dgk_54b">System requirements: On the server running Content Fusion, you need enough disk space
                        to create a backup. The backup file contains a compressed archive of all files located
                        in <filepath>/fusion/data/</filepath>, so to be safe, the free space should be at least
                        equal to the size of the data folder.</li>
                    <li id="li_ol5_dgk_54b">You cannot upgrade <b>Content Fusion</b> on the existing server. It needs to be
                        installed on a new server and all tasks and configurations will be imported to the new
                        server during the upgrade process.</li>
                    <li id="li_pl5_dgk_54b">Custom frameworks and plugins will need to be reinstalled manually on the new

                        the users.</li>
