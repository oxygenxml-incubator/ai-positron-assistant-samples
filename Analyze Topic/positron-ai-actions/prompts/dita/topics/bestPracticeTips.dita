    <title>DITA best practice checks</title>
    <body>
        <p>Using <b>clear and concise language</b> ensures that DITA topics are easily
            understandable by a diverse audience. Avoiding unnecessary jargon and complex
            terminology promotes broader comprehension and accessibility. </p>
        <p><b>Effective titles and short descriptions</b> are vital for user navigation and content
            discovery. Every DITA topic should have a descriptive title and a concise short
            description that accurately summarizes the topic's purpose and content.</p>
        <p>Adhering to the <b>proper structure and elements</b> defined for each DITA topic type is
            essential for ensuring that the content is correctly processed and rendered. Using
            elements that are appropriate for the specific information type helps maintain the
            semantic integrity of the content.</p>
        <p>Including relevant <b>metadata</b> within the <codeph>&lt;prolog></codeph> element of
            DITA topics and maps is a best practice for content management, searchability, and
            enabling features like conditional processing. Consistent and standardized metadata
            enhances the overall value and manageability of the documentation.</p>
        <p>DITA emphasizes the <b>separation of content from formatting</b>. The focus should be on
            semantic markup, describing the meaning and structure of the content, rather than
            applying presentational formatting. Formatting is typically handled during the
            publishing process, allowing for consistent styling across various outputs.</p>
