    <title>XML Refactoring</title>
    <body>
        <p>The XML Refactoring tool in Oxygen XML Editor (available in the Tools menu) helps manage
            the structure of XML documents by allowing users to perform various structure management
            tasks such as inserting, deleting, or renaming attributes in all instances of
            aparticular element. The tool is presented as a wizard with multiple pages, including
            options to configure operation parameters and select the scope and filters for the
            operation. Users can preview the changes before applying them, but there is no automatic
            way to revert the operations once they are finished. Additionally, the tool cannot
            preserve CDATA sections in the XML documents.</p>

            precisly a wizard.  These images present the flow of the operation.</p>
