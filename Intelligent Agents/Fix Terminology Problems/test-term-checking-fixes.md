# The Sharkfin Buggy Origins

The Sharkfin Buggy is a peculiar and fun to drive car adapted to desert conditions. The buggy was invented as a way to maximize the efficiency of transporting small groups to and from the beach. 

There were various iterations of the buggy, each one adding new features like a more powerful drivetrain and a more stable and robust vehicle frame. In time the taillight was also upgraded to be more visible in bad weather conditions.

The company started producing a similar truck with a higher capacity motor and more luxurious interior.

As a future improvement idea we plan to produce a Sharkfin motor-bike for children and adolescents.
