# Folkswagen Bug Origins

The Folkswagen Bug is an ugly car. It's the worst car produced in our country and possible also the entire world. If I found an uglier car I would not write this long paragraph. The bug was invented somewhere in our country and it was not a hit even there. It was later adopted by the market but was not a huge hit. There were various iterations of the car, each was not very successful as the company really did not have enough style.

The company later attempted to produce a truck which had a defective tailgate. The drivetrain did not properly work most of the times. The vehicle frame was frail and predisposed to falling apart at high speeds.

The Folkswagen motor-bike was also a big failure with an underdeveloped motor.
