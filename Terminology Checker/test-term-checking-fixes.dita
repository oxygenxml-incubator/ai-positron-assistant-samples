  <title>The Sharkfin Buggy Origins</title>
    <body>
      <p>The Sharkfin Buggy is a peculiar and fun to drive car adapted to desert conditions. The
      buggy was invented as a way to maximize the efficiency of transporting small groups to and
      from the beach. </p>
    <p>There were various iterations of the buggy, each one adding new features like a more powerful
      drivetrain and a more stable and robust vehicle frame. In time the taillight was also upgraded
      to be more visible in bad weather conditions.</p>
    <p>The company started producing a similar truck with a higher capacity motor and more luxurious
      interior.</p>
    <p>As a future improvement idea we plan to produce a Sharkfin motor-bike for children and
      adolescents.</p>
