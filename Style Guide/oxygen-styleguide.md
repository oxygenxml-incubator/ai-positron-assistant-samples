# Introduction {#introduction}

The vast amount of rules that pertain to writing in the English language can be daunting, to say the least. There are also a lot of different opinions about which of those rules should be followed. There is a difference between the ability to speak in coherent and grammatically correct English and the ability to write effectively in English. Perhaps many of the common rules are not as important when it comes to verbal communication, but written documentation clearly needs to be consistent and follow a set of defined rules. It is also important to distinguish between concrete grammar rules that should always be followed and style rules that are simply guidelines or choices that will help make documentation to be more consistent and potent.

As a general rule for writing technical documentation, it is important to keep it as simple as possible while using enough creativity and solid writing skills to keep the reader engaged long enough to absorb whatever information they need to satisfy the reason they found the particular documentation in the first place. All talented writers have developed their skill over the course of time by writing *A LOT*. However, following a set of rules and guidelines can help less experienced writers, as well as those without native-level language skills. Especially when documentation is written by multiple writers, it is important to have a common set of rules and guidelines to keep the documentation consistent, effective, and professional.

## Grammar Rules {#grammarRules}

This section includes some common concrete grammar rules that should always be followed when writing documentation.

### Common Grammar Errors {#commonGrammarRrrors}

The following grammar errors are some of the most common mistakes that are made while writing in general:

Dangling Modifiers
:   **Rule:** Avoid dangling modifiers to ensure descriptive words or phrases are clear.

:   **Description:** This happens when a descriptive phrase does not apply to the noun that immediately follows it. In other words, a word or phrase that modifies a word not clearly stated in the sentence.

:   **_Example of an error:_** *Before performing the merge, the target item needs to be ready for the operation.*

:   **Problem:** It is unclear what is "performing the merge". Is this implying that the user is performing the merge, or is the "target item", or maybe "the operation"?

:   **Solution:** To fix this problem, try rearranging the structure of the sentence or be more specific. *For example: Before you perform the merge, make sure the target item is ready for the operation.*

Incomplete Comparisons
:   **Rule:** Always complete comparisons.

:   **Description:** When you are implying that something is being compared to something else, you must always clarify what you are comparing it to. Otherwise, it will be difficult for the reader to discern what the comparison actually means.

:   **_Example of an error:_** *Our software is more powerful and efficient.*

:   **Problem:** The software is more powerful and efficient **than what**?

:   **Solution:** Simply finish the comparison. *For example: Our software is more powerful and efficient than all other XML editors.*

Misusing Homonyms
:   **Rule:** Be careful with homonyms since spell checkers will not detect them and avoid using them if you are unsure of which one to use.

:   **Description:** It is impossible for spell checkers to detect misused homonyms. A homonym is a word that is spelled the same way as another word but has a different meaning.

:   **_Examples of homonyms:_** *"affect"/"effect"*, *"illicit"/"elicit"*, *"complement"/"compliment"*, *"obtain"/"attain"*, *"personal"/"personnel"*, *"suit"/"suite"*, *"principal"/"principle"*, *"write"/"right"*

:   **Problem:** The obvious problem with misusing homonyms is that your content will have unintended meaning.

:   **Solution:** Since spell checkers will not detect misused homonyms, you need to proofread your work carefully. Also, if you are not completely sure about the difference between certain homonyms, avoid using those words entirely.

Sentence Fragments
:   **Rule:** Avoid sentence fragments by realizing that every sentence must express a complete thought.

:   **Description:** Quite simply, a sentence fragment is a piece of a sentence that is disconnected from the main clause and cannot stand by itself as a complete sentence.

:   **_Example:_** *Because the URL alone might point to a different item than the one you want and a peg revision is needed.*

:   **Problem:** This fragment does not express a complete thought. The subordinating conjunction *"because"* is dependent upon an independent clause that is missing in this sentence fragment.

:   **Solution:** Every sentence must have at least one main clause and express a complete thought. It is important to proofread your work carefully to identify possible sentence fragments.

Vague Pronouns
:   **Rule:** Always make sure it is clear what pronouns are referring to.

:   **Description:** A pronoun should refer clearly to the word or words it replaces \(called the antecedent\) elsewhere in the sentence or in a previous sentence. Pronouns are words that take the place of a noun \(such as *"you"*, *"it"*, *"who"*, *"they"*, *"everyone"*\).

:   **_Example of an error:_** *Maximize the reuse possibilities for keys in topics by reflecting different values depending on __their__ defined scope.*

:   **Problem:** What is *"their"* referring to? It is probably referring to the defined scope of *"keys"*, but with the way this sentence is written, it could also be referring to the scope of *"topics"*, *"values"*, or possibly even *"reuse possibilities"*.

:   **Solution:** If more than one word could be the antecedent \(or if no specific antecedent is present\) you should edit the sentence to make the meaning more clear. *For example: Maximize the reuse possibilities for keys in topics by reflecting different values depending on the defined scope of the keys.*

### Specific Grammar Rules in Regards to Conjunctions and Adverbs {#specificGrammarRulesConjunctionsAdverbs}

There are a lot of rules that apply to conjunctions and adverbs in English writing. The following are some of the most important grammar rules:

Coordinating Conjunctions vs. Subordinating Conjunctions
:   **Description:** There are two types of conjunctions \(coordinating and subordinating\) and they both can be used to join clauses. Various rules for conjunctions can become very complicated.

:   **Rules to follow:** The most important things to remember are how to punctuate both types and that subordinating conjunctions require more than one clause to avoid a sentence fragment.

:   -   **Coordinating Conjunctions** - A coordinating conjunction joins two main clauses with equal emphasis, or connects any other grammatical unit.
    -   **_The seven coordinating conjunctions:_** *"and"*, *"or"*, *"but"*, *"nor"*, *"so"*, *"for"*, *"yet"*.
    -   **Punctuation rules to follow:** There are three patterns for punctuating coordinating conjunctions:
        1.  **Connecting two independent clauses** - When you connect two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction, use a comma before the conjunction. \{\[Main Clause 1\], \[Coordinating Conjunction\] \[Main Clause 2\]\}

            **_Example:_** *"The sample document contains elements from various namespaces__, so__ you need to use CSS Level 3 extensions to associate specific properties with those elements.*

        2.  **Connecting two items \(other than two main clauses\)** - Do not use a comma. \{\[Item 1\] \[Coordinating Conjunction\] \[Item 2\]\}

            **_Example:_** *"These suggestions __and__ guidelines are meant to help anyone.*

        3.  **Connecting three or more items in a series** - Use a comma after each item \(except for the last\) and before the conjunction. \{\[Item 1\], \[Item 2\], \[Coordinating Conjunction\] \[Item 3\]\}

            **_Example:_** *" It is important to make documentation clear, concise__, and__ comprehensible."*

-   **Subordinating Conjunctions** - A subordinating conjunction emphasizes the idea in the main clause more than the one in the subordinate clause. Also, it causes the clause that it appears in to become dependent. Therefore, it will be a sentence fragment unless it is joined to an independent clause.

    *__Example of a fragment:__ With this option in effect, the referenced schema document is loaded. Unless the absolute URI is the same as a schema document already loaded.* **\(The second sentence is a fragment\)**

    *__Example of a complete sentence:__ With this option in effect, the referenced schema document is loaded unless the absolute URI is the same as a schema document already loaded.* **\(One complete sentence\)**

    -   **_Examples of subordinating conjunctions:_** *"after"*, *"although"*, *"as"*, *"because"*, *"if"*, *"since"*, *"though"*, *"unless"*, *"whenever"*, *"while"*.
    -   **Punctuation rules to follow:** Generally, there are two patterns for punctuating subordinating conjunctions:
        1.  The main clause followed by a subordinate clause. Typically, a comma is not necessary. \{\[Main Clause\] \[Subordinate Clause\]\}

            **_Example:_** *"Saving the file is not allowed __unless__ the file is already checked out.*

        2.  A subordinate clause followed by the main clause. Typically, use a comma after the subordinate clause. \{\[Subordinate Clause\], \[Main Clause\]\}

            **_Example:_** *"DITA is an XML format__, although__ you do not have to write raw XML to create and edit DITA topics.*


Conjunctive Adverbs
:   **Description:**Conjunctive adverbs are simply adverbs that connect two independent clauses. They can sometimes move almost anywhere in a sentence and they are usually used to link the ideas from two or more sentences, but they can also be used to connect two independent main clauses in the same sentence \(although this is probably rare in technical documentation\). Usually, they are placed at the beginning of the second clause since it provides a logical transition from one clause to the other. When used to connect two main clauses a semicolon needs to be used between the first clause and the conjunctive adverb, but again, this is rare in technical documentation. Most of the time, the conjunctive adverbs need to be separated from the clause with one or two commas.

:   **_Examples of conjunctive adverbs:_** *"accordingly"*, *"also"*, *"consequently"*, *"for example"*, *"for instance"*, *"furthermore"*, *"hence"*, *"however"*, *"in fact"*, *"instead"*, *"likewise"*, *"otherwise"*, *"nevertheless"*, *"therefore"*, *"thus"*.

:   **Rules to follow:** For the purposes of User Guide, follow these guidelines:

    -   Except in some very rare circumstances, only use conjunctive adverbs to connect the ideas from multiple sentences.
    -   Most of the time, they should be used at the beginning of a sentence or as the first words inside parentheses.
    -   More often than not, they should be followed by a comma, and if used in the middle of a sentence, they should also be preceded with a comma \(the word *"thus"* is usually only preceded by a comma when used in the middle of a sentence\).

        **Note:** Keep in mind that some of these words can also be used as other grammatical constructs \(for example, *"accordingly"* and *"instead"* are often used as regular adverbs in various parts of sentences without being preceded or followed by a comma\). However, when any of them are used as a conjunctive adverb, the above rules apply.

        -   *"however"* - Somewhat of a special case since it can also be used as a normal verb that means *in whatever way* or *to whatever degree* \(for example, *"However you decide to do it, ..."*\). Regardless, whenever it is used as a conjunctive adverb, follow the rules above.
        -   *"also"* - This is a rather flexible adverb and can be used in multiple other ways \(for example, as a focusing adverb\) without needing punctuation before or after. Regardless, when used as a conjunctive adverb, follow the rules above.

Position of Adverbs in a Sentence
:   **Description:** There are so many complex rules for where to position different types of adverbs within a sentence that it is not even worth discussing most of them. Essentially, an adverb is a word that modifies another word or phrase. In most cases, you should make sure the adverb is placed as close to the word or phrase that it is modifying as possible and you should always pay attention to how the placement of the adverb can change the meaning of the sentence. For more specific rules in regards to the placement of adverbs, the following website defines some very clear rules for various situations: [http://www.englishpractice.com/improve/position-adverbs-2/](http://www.englishpractice.com/improve/position-adverbs-2/).

    **Focusing Adverbs \(_"also"_, _"only"_, _"either"_, _"neither"_, _"just"_, _"mostly"_\):**
    :   For the purposes of our documentation, we should concentrate on making sure certain focusing adverbs are placed in the proper position because they represent the most common errors and improper positioning of these adverbs can lead to sentences that are awkward or where the meaning is unclear. Since focusing adverbs point to a particular part of a sentence, the meaning conveyed often depends upon their position. The adverbs *"also"* and *"only"* are the most common examples that are used in our documentation.

        **_"Only"_** - Consider how the placement of the word *"only"* changes the meaning in the following examples:

        -   **_Example 1:_** *__Only__ John gave Paul one dollar.* \[No one else besides John game him a dollar\].
        -   **_Example 2:_** *John gave __only__ Paul one dollar.* \[John gave Paul a dollar and no one else\].
        -   **_Example 3:_** *John gave Paul __only__ one dollar.* \[John gave Paul one dollar and nothing more\].
        -   **_Example 4:_** *John __only__ gave Paul one dollar.* \[John did nothing else besides giving Paul a dollar.\]

        **_"Also_** - Consider how the placement of the word *"also"* changes the meaning in the following examples:

        -   **_Example 1:_** *__Also__, John thinks that Paul should stop smoking.* \[In addition to other ideas, John thinks Paul should stop smoking.\]
        -   **_Example 2:_** *John thinks that Paul __also__ should stop smoking.* \[John thinks Paul should stop smoking, along with other people.\]
        -   **_Example 3:_** *John thinks Paul should __also__ stop smoking.* \[John thinks Paul should stop smoking, along with stopping other things.\]
        -   **_Example 4:_** *John __also__ thinks that Paul should stop smoking.* \[Someone else and John think that Paul should stop smoking.\]

    :   **Rules to follow:** Most of the time it is best to place focusing adverbs in front of and next to the word or words they are modifying. However, be aware that doing so will not always eliminate ambiguity. Therefore, you have to also rely on the context and consider the meaning of the sentence based upon the placement of the adverb. If you find it difficult to decide where to place them, try rephrasing the sentence entirely.

:   **_Using Adverbs with Modal Verbs_ \(_"can"_, _"could"_, _"may"_, _"might"_, _"must"_, _"will"_, _"would"_, _"shall"_, _"should"_\):**
:   A modal verb is a type of auxiliary verb that is used to indicate the likelihood, possibility, necessity, or ability. Deciding how to position adverbs in relation to model verbs can also become very confusing, especially when the modal verb is used with another verb \(such a form of the infinitive verb *"to be"*.

:   Consider the following examples:

    -   **_Example 1:_** *The sample file __also__ can be found in the SDK distribution.* \[Awkward\]
    -   **_Example 2:_** *The sample file can __also__ be found in the SDK distribution.* \[Better\]

:   **Rules to follow:** While both of the previous examples are grammatically correct and they both have the same meaning, the second one sounds and reads better, and you never want to cause your reader to pause to consider the awkwardness of the flow. There are a lot of exceptions to this rule, but MOST of the time, you should use the following word order when using this type of combination: **_\[Modal Verb\] + \[Adverb\] + \[Verb\]_**.

### Specific Grammar Rules in Regards to Specific Words or Phrases {#specificGrammarRulesWordsPhrases}

The following grammar rules are meant to distinguish when and how to use specific words or which form of a word to use in particular situations:

**_"a"_** vs. **_"an"_**
:   **Description:** This is one of the most common errors made in English writing. There is a common misperception that the rule is that you use *"a"* before words that start with a consonant and *"an"* before words that start with a vowel. However, that is only partially correct. REMEMBER, it is how the subsequent word SOUNDS, not how it is written. The letters 'H' and 'U' usually cause the most confusion because some words that start with those letters have a consonant sound and some have a vowel sound.

:   **Rule to follow:** The rule is that you use *"a"* before words that start with a consonant SOUND and *"an"* before words that start with a vowel SOUND.

:   **_Examples for "a":_** *"Unique" or "URL" - You would use "a'" before both words because they both begin with a 'you' SOUND.* *"Historic" or "High" - You would use "a'" before them because they begin with a consonant 'h' SOUND.*

:   **_Examples for "an":_** *"Unusual" or "Umbrella" - You would use "an'" before both words because they both begin with an 'uh' SOUND.* *"Hour" or "HTTP" - You would use "an'" before them because they begin with an 'a-wer' and 'aye' SOUND, respectively.*

**_"Such as"_** vs. **_"Like"_**
:   **Description:** This is another one of the most common problems found in English writing. Many grammarians consider both to be acceptable, especially when speaking, but when using them in technical writing, you should not use them interchangeably because they have different implications. *"Like"* suggests comparison \(something is similar to something else\), while *"such as"* implies inclusion \(something is precisely included as an example of something\).

:   **Rules to follow:** In most cases, avoid using *"like"* when you can use *"such as"* instead, and only use *"like"* when making some sort of comparison to something similar.

:   **_Example of "such as":_** *You can specify a set of transformation scenarios to convert XML documents to various formats, __such as__ HTML and PDF.*

    **Note:** When *"such as"* is part of a non-restrictive clause, as it is in the above example, it needs to be preceded with a comma \(or the whole clause placed in parentheses\).

:   **_Example of "like":_** *A DITA book map is intended for creating output that is __like__ a book.*

**_"That"_** vs. **_"Which"_**
:   **Description:** There are some experts who believe this is more of a style choice than a grammar rule, but those people are completely ignoring the fact that when these two words are used interchangeably they are usually two completely different types of grammatical words \(*"that"* being an adjective in these instances, and *"which"* being a pronoun/determiner\). Some people might also argue that the rules are more complex and flexible than the rules we will use, but it is important to keep the rules simple and for the purposes of our User Guide, we use these two words in ways that are only grammatically correct and clear if we follow the rules listed below. Also, in most cases, it looks and sounds much better to use this common grammar rule.

    **Note:** It becomes even more complex and confusing when considering combination of words such as *"for which"* or *"in which"*. They are sometimes used instead of *"that"* to prevent ending a sentence with a preposition. However, that becomes a completely different subject and this rule should not be used for those instances. The word *"which"* is also used in multiple ways, some of which are not interchangeable with *"that"* \(for example, *"determine which one to use"*\). To make it as simple as possible, just use this rule to determine when to use the single words *"that"* or *"which"* when they could be used interchangeably.

:   **Rules to follow:** To make a complex topic as simple as possible, use *"that"* before a restrictive clause and *"which"* before a non-restrictive clause.

    -   A restrictive clause is part of a sentence that you can not get rid of because it specifically restricts some other part of the sentence and without it the meaning of the sentence would change \(or the sentence would be incomplete\).
    -   A non-restrictive clause is something that can be left off without changing the meaning of the sentence \(or making it incomplete\) and it is simply additional information.

        **Important:** Non-restrictive clauses are almost always surrounded by, or preceded by, commas. Therefore, whenever you use *"which"* before a non-restrictive clause, it should be preceded with a comma.


:   **_Example of an improper use of "that":_** *This section lists and describes all the contextual menu actions __that__ are also available in various submenus.* \[You should not use *"that"* in this instance because the reader might understand that the section only lists the actions that are in both locations instead of understanding that the section includes ALL the contextual menu actions \(and that they are ALSO available in submenus\). The clause that follows *"that"* in this case is a non-restrictive clause that simply provides additional information. Therefore, you should use *", which"* in this type of instance.

:   **_Example of a proper use of "that":_** *This section explains the actions __that__ are available for a Berkeley DB XML connection.* \[The clause that follows *"that"* cannot be omitted without causing an incomplete sentence and it does not simply provide additional information \(it is essential to the meaning of the sentence\). Therefore, it is a restrictive clause and you must use *"that"* instead of *"which"*\].

:   **_Example of an improper use of "which":_** *The stylesheet contains templates __which__ output the static header and footers for various parts of the PDF.* \[You cannot use *"which"* in this case because the information that follows it is essential to the meaning of the sentence and is not simply providing additional information. In this case, you would need to use *"that"* instead.\]

:   **_Example of a proper use of "which":_** *While you are working on your own branch, other team members can continue to make important changes in the parent branch__, which__ could be the trunk itself or any other branch.* \[The clause that follows *"which"* could be omitted without changing the meaning of the sentence since it simply provides additional information and could even be an independent idea of its own \(for example, by changing *"which"* to *"It"* and making it a new sentence.\]

**_"That"_** vs. **_"Who"_**
:   **Description:** This can be tricky and complicated, but to make it as simple as possible, consider who or what is being described. Some experts say that it is acceptable to use either word when describing a person, but it seems to dehumanize the person when using *"that"* to describe a person.

:   **Rule to follow:** Use *"that"* when describing an object, or *"who"* when describing a person.

:   **_Example of "that"_**: *Permanent reassignment of a Named User to a position __that__ does not involve the use of the Software.*

:   **_Example of "who"_**: *Permanent reassignment of a Named User __who__ owns the rights to the software.*

**_"To either"_** vs. **_"Either to"_**
:   **Description:** This is one of those rules that differ depending on whether you are speaking or writing. Both phrases mean exactly the same thing and when speaking, both phrases are acceptable. However, when writing, *"to either"* is simply MORE grammatically correct.

:   **Rules to follow:** As a general rule, it is better to use *"to either"* since the word "either" implies a choice of two options and by placing the *"to"* in the front, you are removing it from the grammatical construction *'either A or B'*. If you do use *"either to"*, you would need to include a second *"to"* to make the construction grammatically correct \(*'either to A or to B'*\).

:   **_Example of "either to":_** *You can use this API __either to__ print the document or __to__ show the Print Preview dialog box.* \[To make this sentence grammatically correct, notice that you have to use a second *"to"* in front of the second clause.\]

:   **_Example of "to either":_** *You can use this API __to either__ print the document or show the Print Preview dialog box..* \[Notice that by using *"to either"* you do not need a second *"to"* before the second clause to make the sentence grammatically correct.\]

**_"Affect"_** vs. **_"Effect"_**
:   **Description:** These two words are often confused when referring to something changing another thing. The word *"effect"* is a noun, while *"affect"* is a verb.

:   **Rules to follow:** Basically, use *"Effect"* when referring to the change itself \(noun\), and *"Affect"* when referring to the act of changing \(verb\).

:   **_Example of "effect":_** *Documents that contain long lines can have a negative __effect__ on performance.*

:   **_Example of "affect":_** *Documents that contain long lines can __affect__ performance.*

**_"Between"_** vs. **_"Among"_**
:   **Description:** This rule can be confusing, but you simply need to think about whether or not the referenced things are clearly separated.

:   **Rules to follow:** Use *"between"* when referring to multiple things that are clearly separated, and *"among"* for things that you can cannot clearly separate because they are part of a group of objects.

:   **_Example of "between":_** *The DITA Maps Manager organizes the relationships __between__ maps and topics.*

:   **_Example of "among":_** *DITA maps organize the relationships __among__ various topics.*

**_"Different"_** vs. **_"Various"_** or **_"Multiple"_**
:   **Description:** Misusing the word *"different"* is one of the most common problems in formal and technical writing. When speaking, or perhaps in colloquial writing, the two words are often used synonymously, but in formal or technical writing it is important to differentiate between the two. *"Different"* implies a comparison \(*different* from what?\), whereas *"various"* or *"multiple"* implies multiplicity or diversity.

:   **Rules to follow:** Do not use *"different"* when you mean *"various"* or *"multiple"* \(*"other"* and *"another"* are also examples of words that might be better\). Only use *"different"* to refer to comparison or distinction between things. Also, if you are to use the word *"different"*, stop and ask yourself "it is different from what?" If you cannot answer that question or it does not make sense, avoid using *"different"*.

:   **_Example of "different":_** *The name of the directory might be something __different__ on your system.*

:   **_Example of "various":_** *The Quick Fix support helps you resolve __various__ errors that appear in documents.*

**_"However"_** vs. **_"But"_** vs. **_"Although"_**
:   **Description:** These three words are often misunderstood in English writing and many people incorrectly think they are completely synonymous. While their meanings are very similar, *"however"* and *"but"* introduces a contrast or contradiction to a previous statement, while *"although"* does not necessarily imply contrast and can be used if both statements could be true. Also, *"but"* and *"although"* are conjunctions, while *"however"* is an adverb and needs to be used differently in the sentence structure.

:   **Rules to follow:** To make it as simple as possible, follow these rules for each word:

    -   **_"However"_** - When using *"however"*, in most cases it should begin a new sentence and be followed by a comma. Use it when you want to stress contrast or contradiction AND you want to start a new sentence \(therefore contrasting the two sentences\).
    -   **_"But"_** - When using *"but"*, do not ever use it to start a new sentence and it needs to be preceded by a comma. Use it when you want to stress contrast or contradiction AND you do not want to start a new sentence \(therefore contrasting the two parts of the same sentence\).
    -   **_"Although"_** - This word may be used to start a sentence or in the middle of a sentence. When using it to start a new sentence it would not be followed by a comma. When using it in the middle of a sentence it needs to be preceded by a comma. Use it when you want to stress that both parts of the statement may be true \(make sure both parts of the statement are included in the sentence\).

:   **_Example of "however":_** *He knows a lot about general programming. __However,__ he has some confusion about Java programming.*

:   **_Example of "but":_** *She said the book is blue, __but__ I think it is green.*

:   **_Examples of "although":_** *We usually speak in Romanian, __although__ sometimes we use English.* OR *__Although__ we usually speak in Romanian, sometimes we use English.*

**_"Less"_** vs. **_"Fewer"_**
:   **Description:** Despite popular belief, there is a clear difference between when these two words should be used in most cases.

:   **Rules to follow:** Use *"less"* for things that are not quantifiable, and *"fewer"* for things that you can clearly count.

:   **_Example of "less":_** *It uses less memory.*

:   **_Example of "fewer":_** *It uses fewer than 300 MB.*

**_"Whether"_** vs. **_"Whether or not"_**
:   **Description:** There are so many conditions to this rule that it seems that many modern writers have decided that it is too complicated and not worth their time to consider so they simply ignore all of them and never include *"or not"* even when doing so leads to ambiguity. They justify this by suggesting that the *"or not"* is implied when appropriate and is therefore optional. However, this is clearly not always the case. Your meaning can easily become unclear or ideas might seem incomplete if you omit *"or not"* in many cases. In the very least, it might irritate your reader if they have to pause and re-read the sentence, and its surrounding sentences, to decipher the intended meaning.

    Consider the following example: *Oxygen prompts you to choose __whether__ you want to paste the content as XML.* The intended meaning could have been any of the following:

    -   Oxygen prompts you to choose whether you want to paste the content as XML or paste it as something else \(such as text\). \[In this case, the sentence and idea is incomplete and you need to specify what that 'something else' is.\]
    -   Oxygen prompts you to choose whether you want to paste the content as XML, or not at all. \[In this case, it is imperative to use *whether or not* to avoid breaking the flow and possible ambiguity.\]
    -   Oxygen prompts you to choose something \(that was previously mentioned\), regardless of whether or not you want to paste the content. \[In this case, you would need a commas after choose and use *whether or not* or *regardless of whether or not*.\]

:   **Rules to follow:** Consider the following rules when using the word *"whether"*:

    -   If you are differentiating between whether to do something, or to not do something entirely, always use *"whether or not"*.
    -   If you are differentiating between two different things, use *"whether"* and specify both things.
    -   In situations where *"or not"* might be considered optional, it is far better to include it than to omit it. Remember to make sure the meaning of the sentence is clear and that it will not require the reader to stop and re-read it simply because you left out a few extra words that would make it more clear.
    -   In some cases, it might be better to simply use some sort of *"if"* statement instead.
    -   Whenever the use of the word *"whether"* is synonymous to *regardless of whether or not*, you must use *"whether or not"* or *"regardless of whether or not"*.

:   **_Example of "whether":_** *Oxygen prompts you to choose __whether__ you want to paste the content as XML or plain text.*

:   **_Example of "whether or not":_** *Oxygen prompts you to choose __whether or not__ you want to paste the content.*

### Tenses {#tenses}

There are a lot of very complicated rules when it comes to using tenses in English writing. The proper use of tenses is important because improper use could lead to ambiguity and the intended meaning can be inadvertently changed if the wrong tense is used. Without making it more complicated than it needs to be, the following rules are simply guidelines for using tenses to help avoid glaring mistakes:

Consistency in Tenses
:   **Description:** If you shift the tense of verbs from one tense to another without a clear reason, it can confuse your readers. There are instances where it is necessary to change tense, even within the same sentence, but it should only be done when the reason is clear or to make things even more clear.

:   **Rules to follow:** Follow these rules in regards to tense consistency:

    -   In general, keep tenses consistent within sentences and paragraphs.
    -   Avoid changing tenses when there is no time change for an action.
    -   If you do need to change tenses, make sure that there is a clear reason for it.
    -   Always avoid ambiguity.

:   **_Example:_** *Write the description of the problem that __was__ encountered, __send__ it to our support team, and we __will reply__ as soon as possible.* Notice that past, present, and future tenses are used in the same sentence. The reason for the switch to future tense \(*"we will reply"*\) is quite clear. The part of the sentence that is in past tense \(*"that was encountered"*\) could certainly be omitted without changing the meaning, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with keeping it because it simply makes it even more clear.

Future Tense
:   **Description:** In English grammar, future tense is not considered a true tense because tenses express the time of a state or action and the future has not yet happened. Obviously, you need to future tense when referring to something that will clearly happen in the future, but in professional writing, using present tense \(whenever possible\) enhances your message by making it more clear and precise. However, in technical documentation it is much more common and acceptable to use future tense. This is because the instructions often refer to events that will happen in the future or that depend on certain conditions or actions before the events will occur.

:   **Rule to follow:** Avoid future tense when present tense makes the meaning more clear. It is fine to use it when you are referring to something that will specifically happen in the future or requires certain things to happen before it will occur.

:   **_Example of when NOT to use it:_** *Our sample documentation framework __will be__ very simple.* This was an actual example from our User Guide. Notice how ambiguous this sentence is. It will be simple when? Why is it not simple now? Does the user need to do something to make it simple? Clearly, this sentence should be *"Our sample documentation framework __is__ very simple."*

:   **_Example of when you should use it:_** *We __will reply__ as soon as possible.* You have to use future tense in this case because the action will very clearly happen in the future.

Progressive Tense
:   **Description:** The progressive tense is formed with a form of the helping *"to be"* verb, plus the present participle of a main verb with an *"ing"* ending. The use of progressive tenses is not grammatically incorrect, but it requires the use of extra auxiliary verbs and makes your ideas less precise, and possibly less clear. Particularly in technical writing, it should only be used to refer to something that is very clearly an ongoing action and present tense cannot be used in the precise context.

:   **Rule to follow:** Simply avoid progressive tense unless it is absolutely necessary \(for example, when referring to a specific on-going event\).

:   **_Example of when NOT to use it:_** *Oxygen __is changing__ the way you edit documents.* This sentence should be *"Oxygen __changes__ the way you edit documents."* Notice that the second version is more powerful and precise.

:   **_Example of when you should use it:_** *Unfortunately, you cannot minimize the dialog box while the operation __is processing__.* In this instance, it is actually better to use progressive tense since it is referring to the time period during an ongoing event. You could replace *"is processing"* with *"processes"*, but the progressive form is actually more clear and precise in this case.

### Punctuation Rules {#punctuationRules}

Some punctuation rules are really just style choices \(see the [Punctuation Style Rules](#punctuationStyleRules) topic\), although there are some concrete grammar rules in regards to punctuation. This section includes some of those concrete rules:

Commas
:   There are entire courses that provide all sorts of information about the proper usage of commas. For the purposes of our documentation, a few of the most common rules are described in this section.

    Comma After an Introductory Infinitive Phrase
    :   **Description:** An infinitive is a verb form that typically begins with the word *"to"*. An infinitive phrase includes the infinitive, plus any modifiers and complements.

    :   **Rule:** Always use a comma after an introductory infinitive phrase, unless the infinitive phrase is the subject of the sentence. It would be extremely rare for an introductory infinitive phrase to be the subject in our documentation, so you can ignore the second part of the rule. Also, when an infinitive phrase concludes a clause \(rather than introducing it\), no punctuation is necessary.

    :   **_Example of an introductory infinitive phrase:_** *To add index terms to a map__,__ open the map in the editor and add the elements.*

    :   **_Example of an infinitive phrase that concludes a clause:_** *This section explains how to create and work with projects.*

    Commas \(or Parentheses\) Before and After Parenthetical Expressions
    :   **Description:** A parenthetical expression is a phrase or clause that is inserted within another phrase or clause.

    :   **Rule:** Use commas or parentheses \(brackets\) to separate parenthetical expressions.

    :   **_Example with commas:_** *This is useful if, for instance, you want to upgrade your existing license.*

    :   **_Example with parentheses:_** *This is useful if \(for instance\) you want to upgrade your existing license.*

    Comma to Separate an Introductory Word or Phrase
    :   **Description:** An introductory phrase, or introductory word, is simply one that begins a sentence, and includes[conjunctive adverbs](#conjunctive-adverbs-dlentry) \(such as *"however"*, *"also"*, *"therefore"*, etc.\)

    :   **Rule:** At the beginning of a sentence, introductory words or phrases require a subsequent comma.

    :   **_Example:_** *In the beginning__,__ I had no idea how to use a comma.*

    Comma to Separate Each Segment in a Series
    :   **Description:** In all forms of writing, commas usually separate more than two segments in a series, although the comma before the last segment, called a Serial Comma, is considered optional and therefore becomes a style choice.

    :   **Rule:** When there are more than two segments in a series, each segment should be separated by a comma. For the purposes of the User Guide, the [style rule is that we always include the serial comma](#serial-comma-dlentry) when there is more than two segments \(to avoid any possible ambiguity\).

    :   **_Example:_** *It provides support to help you edit__,__ transform__,__ and debug XML-based documents.*

        **Note:** Do not separate TWO segments with a comma unless they are [independent clauses](#comma-independent-clause-dlentry). No comma is needed when a conjunction joins two phrases that modify the same verb.

    Comma to Separate Independent Clauses
    :   **Description:** An independent clause is a sentence that can stand on its own.

    :   **Rule:** You should use commas to separate independent clauses that are joined by [coordinating conjunctions](#coordinating-conjunctions-li) . Here is how to test it: Would the second part of the sentence \(following the coordinating conjunction\) make a full sentence on its own? If so, add a comma. If not, leave it out.

    :   **_Example:_** *This tool is very powerful__,__ and it includes a lot of user-friendly features.*

    Comma to Separate Non-restrictive Clauses
    :   **Description:** Similar to parenthetical expressions, a non-restrictive clause adds extra information that is not essential to the basic meaning of the sentence.

    :   **Rule:** Use commas to separate non-restrictive clauses. When a non-restrictive clause appears in the middle of a sentence, place commas before and after it. When a non-restrictive clause appears at the end of a sentence, place a comma before it.

    :   **_Example:_** *You can use the visual WebHelp Skin Builder tool__,__ which does not require knowledge of CSS language__,__ to change the overall appearance of the output.*

### Common Grammar Rule Myths or Misperceptions {#commonGrammarRuleMythsMisperceptions}

Some English grammar rules are ambiguous and debatable. Various grammar guides and experts sometimes differ when it comes to certain rules. Most experts come to a common consensus in regards to many of these ambiguous rules, while others simply become style choices when there does not seem to be a common opinion. Some of these complicated rules have also evolved or changed over time and can therefore become misperceptions.

This section includes some of the most common misperceptions in regards to grammar rules:

Misperception: Do not end a sentence with a preposition.
:   **Description:** There is simply more to it than that. The rule is really that you should not end a sentence with a preposition when the sentence would mean the same thing if you left off the preposition. However, there are instances where it is better to end a sentence with a preposition. Examples of prepositions include: *about*, *above*, *after*, *below*, *before*, *between*, *except*, *for*, *from*, *in*, *off*, *on*, *onto*, *out*, *to*, *until*, *with*, *without*.

:   **Rules to follow:** Do not end a sentence with a preposition if removing it would not change the meaning. Also, it is better to end a sentence with a preposition that cannot be removed than to make the sentence sound awkward trying to avoid it.

:   **_Example 1:_** *The new location in the same repository you are switching __to__.* \[OK\]

:   **_Example 2:_** *The new location in the same repository __to which__ you are switching.* \[AWKWARD\]

Misperception: Do not split infinitives.
:   **Description:** An infinitive is a two-word form of a verb, such as *"to read"* or *"to understand"*. There is a common misperception that you should not split infinitives, but there is actually nothing wrong with doing so, although in technical writing it often means that you are adding an unnecessary word. There are quite a few instances where using split infinitives add meaning to a sentence. A common example is the phrase *"to better understand"*. Including the word *"better"* certainly adds some meaning. There are usually other ways to include these types of powerful words without using them to split infinitives, but you also want to avoid awkward sentences.

:   **Rules to follow:** Even though there is nothing grammatically wrong with splitting infinitives, in technical writing, it is safer to avoid them, if possible. However, you should also avoid creating awkward sentences by trying too hard to avoid splitting infinitives. If you need to use an extra word to add meaning and using that extra word to split an infinitive makes the sentence less awkward than the alternatives, keep the split infinitive.

:   **_Example 1:_** *You can also customize the actions in the toolbar __to better suit__ your needs.* \[OK\]

:   **_Example 2:_** *You can also customize the actions in the toolbar to suit your needs better.* \[AWKWARD\]

Misperception: Do not start a sentence with adverbs \(such as *"Also"* or *"However"*\).
:   **Description:** This rule is highly debated and often becomes a matter of style choice, but it also depends on the type of adverb and proper punctuation is important. An adverb describes, modifies, or provides more information about a verb, and they usually end in *"ly"*. In general, you should not begin sentences with common adverbs. However, this is not the case with conjunctive adverbs. These adverbs are used as transitions between sentences, they often can move almost anywhere in a sentence, and it is absolutely acceptable to begin a sentence with most conjunctive adverbs as long as you use proper punctuation \(they should be followed by a comma\).

:   **Rules to follow:** It is fine to begin a sentence with most conjunctive adverbs as long as they are followed by a comma. As a general rule, you should not begin a sentence with any other type of adverb.

:   **_Examples of conjunctive adverbs that are acceptable to begin a sentence with:_** *Accordingly*, *Also*, *Consequently*, *Finally*, *For example*, *For instance*, *Furthermore*, *Hence*, *However*, *Incidentally*, *In fact*, *In other words*, *Instead*, *Likewise*, *Meanwhile*, *On the contrary*, *On the other hand*, *Otherwise*, *Nevertheless*, *Next*, *Nonetheless*, *Similarly*, *Therefore*, *Thus*. **Remember that if you begin a sentence with any of these, they need to be followed by a comma.**

Misperception: Do not start a sentence with conjunctions.
:   **Description:** This is one of those rules in English grammar where most people are taught that it is wrong, but most experts agree that it is acceptable to do so. However, even though it is technically acceptable, it does not mean that it should be done because it could lead to incomplete sentences, it can sound quite monotonous, and it is often perceived as being unprofessional and irritating to the reader. Ultimately, it really depends on the type of writing and it becomes a style choice. For example, it is far more acceptable and common in general writing than in technical writing.

:   **Rules to follow:** In technical writing, it is only appropriate to begin sentence with certain [subordinating conjunctions](#subordinating-conjunctions-li), but never with [coordinating conjunctions](#coordinating-conjunctions-li). In most cases, you do not use a comma after a subordinating conjunction that begins a sentence and the most important thing to remember is that you need to avoid sentence fragments.

:   **_Examples of conjunctions that are acceptable to begin a sentence with \(AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT LEAD TO A SENTENCE FRAGMENT\):_** Certain subordinating conjunctions \(*"after"*, *"although"*, *"as soon as"*, *"because"*, *"before"*, *"even though"*, *"if"*, *"in case"*, *"now that"*, *"once"*, *"since"*, *"though"*, *"unless"*, *"until"*, *"when"* *"whenever"*, *"while"*\).

:   **_Examples of conjunctions that you should NOT begin a sentence with:_** All coordinating conjunctions \(*"and"*, *"or"*, *"but"*, *"nor"*, *"so"*, *"for"*, *"yet"*\), along with some subordinating conjunctions \(*"so that"*, *"than"*, *"why"*\). Again, the most important thing is to avoid sentence fragments.

Misperception: Paragraphs must include more than one sentence.
:   **Description:** A paragraph can be a single sentence. There is no rule against it and if you can say what you need to say in a single sentence that lacks a direct connection with other sentences, it is better to stop there and go to a new paragraph.

:   **Rules to follow:** All the sentences in a paragraph should have some sort of logical connection, but you also do not want the paragraphs to be so long that your readers feel like they are facing an endless wall of text and skip important information. There is nothing wrong with only including one sentence in a paragraph, especially in technical writing, but you also do not want to arbitrarily create multiple, sequential paragraphs with a single sentence when their ideas are clearly connected.

## Style Rules for the User Guide {#styleRules}

Style rules are not concrete writing rules. Instead, they are style choices. There are no concrete right or wrong ways to choose style rules. However, it is important to be consistent with style choices to make documentation readable and appealing. You certainly do not want to irritate your audience by using multiple, inconsistent, and incompatible styles.

To maintain consistent, readable, and visually appealing documentation, we will use a number of *Style Rules* for the oXygen User Guide.

### General Style Rules {#generalStyleRules}

The following *Style Rules* provide guidelines for general documentation style choices.

Capitalization in Hyphenated Words in Titles
:   **Description:** This rule defines how to capitalize hyphenated words in titles.

:   **Rule:** Always capitalize the first letter of the first word before the hyphen \(regardless of the type of word or its length\). For the subsequent words, consider them separate words and follow the same rules as for[Titles/Headings](#titles-headings-dlentry).

Capitalization in Titles/Headings
:   **Description:** These rules are meant to define how to capitalize words in titles and headings in our documentation.

:   **Rules:** Follow these style rules for the User Guide:

    -   Capitalize the first letter of the first word, regardless of the number of letters or type of word.
    -   Capitalize the first letter of all nouns.
    -   Capitalize the first letter of all verbs.
    -   Capitalize all letters of acronyms, unless the common naming convention for a specific acronym dictates otherwise \(for example, *"HiDPI"*\).
    -   Capitalize the first letter of all other words that have at least 4 letters, with the exception of the prepositions and conjunctions listed below.
    -   DO NOT capitalize the prepositions *"from"*, *"like"*, *"into"*, *"over"*, *"with"*, or the conjunction *"that"*.
    -   DO NOT capitalize words with 3 or fewer letters \(except for nouns, verbs, and the first word\), including the following words: *"a"*, *"an"*, *"and"*, *"as"*, *"at"*, *"but"*, *"by"*, *"for"*, *"in"*, *"it"*, *"of"*, "nor", "on", "or", "the", "to", "up".
    -   DO NOT capitalize specific names of code components \(such as the names of elements, attributes, etc.\) Use proper tags \(`codeph`\) for them, even in titles.
    -   When listing company names or products in titles, use the same capitalization format that they use.

Company or Product Names
:   **Description:** This rule defines how to write company and product names.

:   **Rule:** When listing company names or products, use the same capitalization format and naming convention that the company uses \(for example, *"oXygen"* or *"XProc"*\).

Icons
:   **Description:** These rules are meant as a guideline when listing interface icons for actions \(such as toolbar and menu actions\).

:   **Rules:** Follow these style rules for the User Guide:

    -   Whenever listing an action that has an icon on the toolbar or in a menu, include an image of the icon before the name of the action.
    -   When using icons before the name of an action, do not add a space between the icon and the action name.
    -   Put both the icon and the name of the action inside a `uicontrol`.
    -   Whenever possible, use a maximum height of 16 pixels.
    -   Avoid using layers, transparency, or other metadata.
    -   Use a white background.
    -   Use PNG for the format. When using GIMP, deselect all of the *save as* options.

Images
:   **Description:** These rules are meant as a guideline when using images in the documentation.

:   **Rules:** Follow these style rules for the User Guide:

    -   Generally, it is best to only include images to supplement the content and provide some sort of useful context for the reader. For example, it is not necessary to include images for features or dialog boxes that are self explanatory.
    -   Unless the image is very small and appears in the middle of a block of text, it is always best to include the image in a `fig` element and include a title.
    -   The maximum height and width is 650 pixels, but it is always best to make the images as small as possible without sacrificing resolution.
    -   Use a white background.
    -   Use PNG for the format. When using GIMP, deselect all of the *save as* options.

Links
:   **Description:** It is better to include more links than what is necessary, rather than leaving your readers without the means for easily navigating to other pertinent content.

:   **Rules:** Provide links whenever more clarification could be helpful. The types of things that should be linked include:

    -   Pronouns and other specific terms that may not be common knowledge. Glossary terms should be used in many of these cases.
    -   When listing a specific option \(such as options in a Preference page, specific dialog box, menu, etc.\) a link should be included to reference the specific topic that describes the option.
    -   Whenever referring to certain specifications or other external resources, provide links to those specific resources.
    -   Use cross references to other topics that have more information about specific ideas.
    -   Use related links to other topics that include similar information about the current topic.

Lists
:   **Description:** The various types of lists are indented differently in the output and therefore certain list types look better in particular situations. These rules are meant to define what type of lists to use in certain situations.

    **Rules:** Use the following guidelines for the type of lists to use in the User Guide:

    -   The most important rule to follow is that you should always consider the most commonly used output format and try to provide a visually appealing contrast for lists. You do not want your readers to become discouraged with a seemingly never ending wall of unordered lists \(or other types of lists, one after another\).
    -   When describing actions or options \(for example, the topics that describe the preference pages\), it is better to use definition lists \(`dl`\), especially for parent nodes. Unordered lists \(`ul`\) can be used in the `dd` elements for lists inside the definition lists to provide contrast.
    -   When documenting procedural information, use unordered lists \(`ul`\) when steps do not need to occur in sequence.
    -   When documenting procedural information, always use ordered lists \(`ol`\) when the steps must occur in a sequence.

Notes
:   **Description:** These rules are meant to define when and how to use note elements.

:   **Rules:** Follow these style rules in regards to notes in the User Guide:

    -   If possible, avoid adding consecutive notes.
    -   If necessary to add consecutive notes, then use different types.
    -   Add a note when:
        -   You want to emphasize something important.
        -   The idea does not fit with the flow of the section.

Parentheses
:   **Description:** These rules are meant to define when and how to use parentheses.

:   **Rules:** Parentheses can be used to set apart additional information that is useful to the reader but not integral to the rest of the sentence. Follow these style rules for the User Guide:

    -   When using them in normal writing \(as opposed to some sort of code\), use parentheses \(brackets\) instead of square brackets, hyphens, semicolons, or any other symbol.
    -   Typically, you should place text that is surrounded by parentheses inside a sentence, rather than as a sentence of its own. In most instance in our documentation, if it is a complete sentence of its own, the content should not be in parentheses.
    -   Whatever is inside the parentheses, it must not be grammatically integral to the surrounding sentence. If it is, the sentence must be rewritten.
    -   Follow the [punctuation inside parentheses rules](#punctuation-inside-parentheses-dlentry).

Possession
:   **Description:** Normally, in English writing, you indicate possession for a singular noun with an apostrophe plus the letter *"s"*. It can be a bit complicated when dealing with nouns that end in an *"s"* \(plural or singular\) and it can sometimes lead to confusion. However, in technical writing, it is better to avoid using possession to avoid any possibility of confusion. In most instances, there is an alternate way of writing sentences that might include words that show possession. While these alternate ways might sometimes seem overly formal for general writing or spoken communication, in technical writing, not only are they acceptable, but they are actually preferred because the more formal ways of writing the sentences are usually considered to be more professional and more grammatically correct.

:   **Rule:** Avoid using possessives in the User Guide, if at all possible. If you find yourself using an apostrophe to show possession, rewrite the sentence. There might be some rare cases where you cannot find a better ways of writing the sentence and in those cases, use an apostrophe plus *"s"* at the end of singular nouns and just an apostrophe at the end of words that end in *"s"* \(plural or singular\).

Plural Acronyms
:   **Description:** These rules define how to list plural acronyms. This is a difficult one to define because there are a lot of different opinions about it among experts and there does not seem to be a consensus for how they should be written. The problem is that there are a variety of ways that acronyms are read and deciphered and there is a lot of different opinions about which method looks the best and which methods cause the most ambiguity. The rules that were chosen are meant to make it as simple as possible while avoiding as much ambiguity as possible.

:   **Rules:** Follow these style rules for the User Guide:

    -   DO NOT use *'s* at the end of acronyms since apostrophes are meant to denote possession. Since we try to avoid using possession, and hence apostrophes, in our documentation, we certainly do not want to cause confusion by using them to signify a plural acronym.
    -   To prevent any type of confusion, if at all possible, try to avoid using plural acronyms entirely. Try to find a way to write the sentence in singular form or expand the acronym to its full name.
    -   If you do need to use a plural acronym, capitalize all letters of the actual acronym and then use a lower case *s* at the end. If it seems to look odd, use italics for the *s*. This also applies to acronyms that end in an *S* \(for example, CMS*s*\).

Punctuation in Lists or Steps
:   **Description:** These rules define how to use punctuation at the end of lists or steps.

:   **Rules:** Follow these style rules for the User Guide:

    -   DO NOT use semi-colons at the end of list items or steps.
    -   Be consistent with the ending punctuation for all items \(bullets\) within a list or step.
    -   Use a period at the end of the list items or steps, or a colon if introducing another list inside the list item or step.
    -   If each bullet only contains one word \(or a series of proper nouns\), punctuation is not necessary and usually looks better without.

Spelling: American vs. British English
:   **Description:** There are some words that are spelled differently in these two forms of English \(for example, *"color"* in American English vs. *"colour"* in British English\). It is certainly grammatically acceptable to use either convention as long as you are consistent. This rule is meant to define which convention we should use for such words in our documentation.

:   **Rule:** Since we have more customers in North America than in Great Britain, we will always use American English spelling for our documentation.

Structured Markup
:   **Description:** It is important to use markup liberally and consistently to make the documentation more visually appealing and readable. These rules are meant to be general guideline for using tags consistently throughout the documentation.

:   **Rules:** The following list is just some of the most common tags that are used in the User Guide, and a description of the type of content that should be placed in the tags.

    -   **API Names \(`apiname`\)** - Use this tag for specific names of API extensions, methods, and classes.
    -   **Bold \(`b`\)** - Use this tag to provide an emphasis on certain text.
    -   **Code Phrases \(`codeph`\)** - Use this tag for the specific names of elements, attributes, and other snippets of code.
    -   **File Paths \(`filepath`\)** - Use this tag for listing the name of a specific file or file path.
    -   **Italic \(`i`\)** - Use this tag for content that should stand out from normal text.
    -   **Keyboard Shortcuts \(`shortcut`\)** - Use this tag to identify keyboard shortcuts.
    -   **Notes \(`note`\)** - Use this tag for drawing attention to additional information beyond the main text. Use the `type` attribute to differentiate multiple contiguous notes or to define their importance.
    -   **Oxygen \(`product`\)** - Use the `product` key whenever referring to oXygen.
    -   **Terms \(`term`\)** - Use this tag for glossary terms and other words or phrases that the reader might want an additional explanation or definition.
    -   **UI Controls \(`uicontrol`\)** - Use this tag for specific names of user interface items, such as names of buttons, actions, dialog boxes, views, menus, and modes \(**Text**, **Author**, **Grid**, or **Design**\). Alternatively, `wintitle` can be used for names of such things as dialog boxes, views, modes, or windows since `uicontrol` and `wintitle` tags are rendered the same in all the outputs.
    -   **WebApp \(`webappProduct`\)** - Use the `webappProduct` code template whenever referring to WebApp \(the product or component\).

        **Tip:** It is useful to transform individual topics into XHTML to see how the use of tags will look in the output.


Writing Approach for Creating Topics
:   **Description:** These rules are meant to provide basic guidelines for the type of approach that should be used for creating topics in the User Guide.

:   **Rules:** Follow these rules for creating topics in the User Guide:

    -   Each topic should be based on a single overall idea.
    -   Each topic should be complete in and of itself, while linking to other related and relevant information.
    -   Each topic should be able to stand on its own without requiring the user to read other topics prior to the current one.
    -   Regardless of how the topics are organized the map, users should be able to read them in any order and skip around to other topics without a required sequence. However, topics should also be arranged in a logical order in the map or table of contents so that users can navigate in a logical sequence, if they so desire.
    -   Each topic should be designed so that it makes sense if readers find it with the first result from a search.

        **Tip:** Consider the following example. This was originally the first sentence in a topic about custom XML refactoring operations: *If none of the predefined operations will help you accomplish a particular refactoring task, you can create a custom operation that is specific to your needs.* If this was the first topic they came across in a specific search, they may question what "predefined operations" the topic is referring to, especially since there was no link to the predefined operations. Accordingly, it is better to begin the topic with this sentence: *While Oxygen XML Editor includes a variety of predefined XML refactoring operations to help you accomplish particular tasks, you can also create custom operations according to your specific needs.*


### Use of Specific Words \(Style Rules\) {#useSpecificWords}

The following *Style Rules* provide guidelines for the use of particular words:

**_"Authors"_** vs. **_"Writers"_**
:   **Rule:** Simply as a matter of company preference, use *"content authors"* instead of *"technical writers"*.

**_"Combo Box"_** vs. **_"Combobox"_**
:   **Rule:** Use *"combo box"* instead of *"combobox"*.

**_"Cursor"_** vs. **_"Caret"_**
:   **Rules:** Use *"cursor"* instead of *"caret"*.

**_"Dialog Box"_** vs. **_"Dialog"_**
:   **Rule:** Use *"dialog box"* instead of *"dialog"*.

**_"Drop-Down Menu"_** vs. **_"Combo Box_**
:   **Rule:** Use *"drop-down menu"* or *"drop-down list"* when referring to composite buttons that include submenus.

**_"Enabled/Disabled"_** vs. **_"Selected/Deselected_**
:   **Rule:** Use a form of *"enable"* when referring to a feature or something general, but use a form of *"select"* when referring to a specific UI option \(for example, where you select a checkbox\).

**_"etc."_**
:   **Rule:** Typically, only use *"etc."* inside parentheses. For example: *"\(XML parser, XSLT transformer, XQuery engine, etc.\)"*

**_"Following"_** vs. **_"Next"_**
:   **Rule:** In present tense instances where you are introducing something that follows \(such as *"In the subsequent chapters..."*\), use *"following"* or *"subsequent"* instead of *"next"* \(for example, *"In the following image..."* rather than *"In the next image..."*\).

**_"For Example"_** vs. **_"e.g."_** vs. **_"i.e."_**
:   **Rule:** Since there is a lot of ambiguity in regards to when and how to use these abbreviations *"e.g."* and *"i.e."*, it is safer to NEVER use either of them. Instead, be specific and use the full versions \(*"For example"* or *"In other words"*\).

**_"Includes"_** vs. **_"Comes with"_**
:   **Rule:** In most cases, use *"includes"* instead of *"comes with"* \(for example, *"oXygen includes a user-friendly interface..."*\).

**_"Multiple"_** vs. **_"More than one"_**
:   **Rule:** Use *"multiple"* instead of *"more than one"*.

**_"Schemas"_** vs. **_"Schemata"_** \(plural\)
:   **Rule:** Use *"Schemas"* instead of *"Schemata"* to refer to the plural form of the word.

**_"They"_** vs. **_"He/She"_**
:   **Rule:** Use *"they"* rather than *"he/she"*.

**_"You"_** vs. **_"One"_**
:   **Rule:** Use *"you"* rather than an impersonal *"one"*.

### Oxygen-Related Naming Convention Rules {#oxygenRelatedNamingConventionRules}

The following &lt;i&gt;Style Rules&lt;/i&gt; provide guidelines for using Oxygen-related names and components:

Oxygen
:   **Rule:** Use the product key when referring to the various forms of *"Oxygen"*, unless it is in a link, name of a file path, legal reference, or a tag that does not allow the insertion of the product key.

Ellipses in UI Names
:   **Rule:** Do not use ellipses when listing interface actions, even if it has them in its name.

Content Completion
:   **Rule:** Use *"Content Completion Assistant"* \(inside a `wintitle`\) when referring to the specific name of this feature. You can use *"content completion"* or *"content completion assistance"* for a general reference to the subject.

Editing Modes
:   **Rule:** When specifically referring to one of the modes, use *"editing mode"* or *"mode"* instead of *"editor"* \(for example, *"__Text__ editing mode"* or *"__Text__ mode"* instead of *"__Text__ editor"*. It is fine to use *"editor"* when referring to the editor window in general \(without reference to the specific mode\).

### Punctuation Style Rules {#punctuationStyleRules}

The following *Style Rules* pertain to punctuation:

Serial Commas
:   **Description:** A serial comma \(also known as the Oxford comma\) is a comma that is placed immediately before coordinating conjunctions \(*"and"*, *"or*\) in a series of three or more items. In other words, it is the comma that comes before the final item in the series. This is just a style rule and some writers choose to always include the serial comma, while others choose to never include it. The important thing is to always be consistent. However, omitting the serial comma can sometimes leads to ambiguity, especially in complex sentences, so it seems more logical to always include it rather than always omitting it.

:   **Rules:** Always include a serial comma in a series of three or more items. Do not use a serial comma for just two items.

:   **_Example:_** *The following search actions can be applied on pattern, phase__,__ or diagnostic types and are available from the Search submenu.* \[Notice that the serial comma is included before the third item in the series \(before the *"or"* conjunction\), but a comma is NOT included before *"and"* because the content after that conjunction is not part of the series of items \(*"pattern"*, *"phase"*, *"diagnostic types"*\).

Punctuation at the end of Parentheses
:   **Description:** There are usually two rules for using punctuation at the end of parentheses, depending on whether or not the content inside the parentheses is a complete sentence. However, in our documentation, content inside parentheses should never be a complete sentence, so our rules are quite simple.

:   **Rules:** When ending punctuation is required after parentheses, always place it outside the parentheses. There might seem to be an exception to this when the last word in the parentheses is a contraction that requires a period \(for example, *etc.*\), but it actually still applies in that case because you would put the punctuation inside and outside the ending parenthesis.

Inside Quotations
:   **Description:** There are two conflicting style rules in regards to whether punctuation goes inside or outside quotations, depending on whether you use American or British English rules. Since we use very few quotation marks in our documentation, it is unnecessary to go into extensive details about these rules. Instead, in those rare instances where quotations are used, we will use a simplified version of the American rules.

:   **Rules:** In the rare instances where quotations are required, always place commas and periods inside the closing quotations mark, while semicolons, colons, and dashes always go outside the closing quotation mark. Avoid using other punctuation with quotations, or avoid using quotations.

Hyphens
:   **Description:** There are a lot of complicated rules in regards to using hyphens and they depend on the type of word or words in question. Fortunately, there are really only two types of instances that we need to focus on for our documentation since all other possible instances would be very rare in our style of technical writing. In our case, the two types of words that require rules for hyphens are compound adjectives and prefixes.

:   **Rules for compound adjectives:** Compound adjectives are two or more words that are combined to make an adjective and therefore describe a noun or noun phrase. Follow these rules in regards to hyphenating compound adjectives:

    -   Always hyphenate compound words that include hyphens in their dictionary definitions. Examples: *"right-click*, *"double-click"*, *"built-in"*, *"pop-up"*, *"drop-down"*, *"on-site"*.
    -   Hyphenate compound adjectives whenever they are placed before a noun.
    -   Do not hyphenate compound adjectives when they are placed after a noun, unless they are hyphenated by definition.
    -   Do not hyphenate compounds that are formed with *"ly"* adverbs, even when they precede a noun they modify \(for example, *"fully developed program"*\)
    -   The most important thing is to avoid ambiguity, so if there is still a question as to whether or not to hyphenate the compound words, it is better to hyphenate them than the reverse.
    -   DO NOT hyphenate the following words: *"plugin"*, *"screenshot"*, *"checkbox"*

:   **Rules for prefixes:** When it comes to hyphenating prefixes, it is completely a style choice, but it is important to avoid ambiguity and it is preferable to hyphenate words that would otherwise look awkward. Based on that, in most cases, prefixes that result in two consecutive vowels should be hyphenated.

    -   **Examples of prefixes to hyphenate:** *"co-exist"*, *"co-owner"*, *"re-enable"*, *"re-executing"*, *"re-engineering"*, *"re-evaluate"*, and ALL words that use the *"non-"* prefix.

Semi-Colons
:   **Rule:** The only time that semi-colons should ever be used in the User Guide is in `codeblocks`.

Exclamation Marks
:   **Rule:** Except for very rare instances, it is not necessary to use exclamation marks in the User Guide.

### DITA Rules {#ditaStructure}

Here we describe how specific DITA elements should be used.

## Style Rules for the Website {#websiteRules}

This section includes some basic style rules specifically for documenting certain parts of the website.

**What's New Section**
:   The following *Style Rules* pertain to adding features in the *What's New* sections of the website.

    Content of Features
    :   **Rule:** Whenever possible, the content of each feature should focus on its actual benefit to the end user.

    Links to the User Guide
    :   **Rule:** Add links to the User Guide for features in which users might want more information.

    Structured Markup
    :   **Rules:** The following list is some of the most common tags that are used in the website, and a description of the type of content that should be placed in the tags.

        -   **Bold \(`strong`\)** - Use the `strong` tag when referring to **Text**, **Author**, **Grid**, or **Design** modes.
        -   **Emphasis \(`emf`\)** - Use the `emf` tag for names of UI controls.
        -   **Italics \(`italic`\)** - Use the `italic` tag for content that would normally be wrapped in various code-related DITA elements \(such as `codeph`, `apiname`, `filepath`, etc.\)
        -   **oXygen \(`product`\)** - Use the `product` key whenever referring to oXygen.

Other Style Rules for the Website
:   The following are other *Style Rules* that pertain the website.

    Time Zones
    :   **Rule:** When referring to time zones in North America, use the 2 letter abbreviation \(*ET* for Eastern Time\). DO NOT use the 3 letter abbreviation \(for example, *EDT* or *EST*\) to avoid causing confusion or listing an inaccurate time.

    Syncro Soft
    :   **Rule:** Use *"Syncro Soft"* unless *"Syncro"* is clearly defined as *"Syncro Soft"* in the document.

## Writing Tips and Suggestions {#writingTips}

The writing rules and tips listed in this section are more suggestions than concrete rules, but they are important to make documentation clear, concise, effective, absorbing, and comprehensible. These suggestions and guidelines are meant to help anyone improve their writing skills.

Good Documentation Requires Relentless Editing
:   If you *really* want to produce great documentation, it needs to be proofread and edited. No matter how talented a writer happens to be, it is nearly impossible to avoid mistakes on the first attempt.

    **Tips for proofreading and editing:**

    -   It is often a good idea to write all of your text, then take a break from it, and return to proofread and edit it later with fresh eyes and ideas.
    -   When proofreading your text, shorten, delete, and rewrite anything that does not add to its meaning.
    -   It is also a good idea to have someone else review your documentation because when you read something you wrote yourself, you know what you *meant* to write, so it is really easy to just skip over typos or missing words.
    -   If you are editing your own work, changing the indent structure or font size can help you recognize mistakes that were previously unnoticed.

Basic Writing Rules
:   The following rules are suggestions in regards to general writing standards:

    Complete Sentences
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Except in extraordinary circumstances, sentences should always be complete. Proofread your work carefully to spot sentence fragments that are written as if they are complete sentences.

    Redundancy
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** It is usually a good practice to avoid redundancy, or extra unnecessary words, in your writing. Redundancy makes your writing less effective because it makes the reader waste time and attention re-reading information that was already provided. The point of your writing should be to provide all the necessary information in the most precise and effective manner possible. There are times when it is good to use redundancy for emphasis, but in all other situations it is best to avoid it.

    :   **_Examples of redundant phrases to avoid in technical writing:_**

        -   *"add an additional"* - The word *"additional"* is redundant.
        -   *"during the course of"* - The words *"course of"* are repetitive.
        -   *"end result"* - The word *"end"* is not needed.
        -   *"final outcome"* - The word *"final"* is repetitive.
        -   *"in order to"* - The words *"in order"* are not needed.
        -   *"merge together"* - The word *"together"* is redundant.
        -   *"since the time you last"* - You can omit *"the time"* and just use *"since you last*. This also applies without the word *"last"*. For example, *"since the time you opened the file"* should be *"since you last opened the file"*.
        -   *"still remains"* - The word *"still"* is unnecessary.
        -   *"unintentional mistake"* - All mistakes are *"unintentional"*, so that word is redundant.
        -   *"variety of different"* - If there is a variety of something, it is implied that they are different, thus *"different"* is redundant.
        -   Avoid using unnecessary adverbs that are NOT specifically used for some sort of emphasis \(for example, *"very"*, *"little"*, *"pretty"*, *"extremely"*\).

    Run-on Sentences
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** A run-on sentence is one that joins clauses that could each stand on its own as a sentence without any punctuation or words to link them. Fused sentences must be either divided into separate sentences or joined by adding conjunctive words or punctuation. Always consider the general flow and the length of the sentences to decide whether to separate them or add conjunctions.

    Structure of Paragraphs
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** The ideas in all the sentences in a paragraph should be interconnected. If you introduce a completely new thought, you need to start a new paragraph. The ideas should also flow in proper sequence so that you do not confuse the reader. Also, do not make the paragraphs too long because your readers might get disinterested and feel like they are inundated with too much information at once.

    Structure of Sentences
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Try to avoid starting a sentence with one kind of structure and then changing to another later in the sentence. Doing so can confuse your readers.

    Structure of Topics
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Make sure the whole topic has a good flow. Usually, you will want to introduce the concept, then provide the specific content that will provide the reader with all the information they need, then wrap it up with some sort of conclusion that summarizes everything or clearly indicates the end of the topic.

    Transitions
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Each paragraph should transition smoothly from the preceding paragraph. Without good transitions, the reader will end up backtracking repeatedly and will often become confused or frustrated.

Basic Technical Writing Rules
:   The following rules are suggestions in regards to technical writing standards:

    Ambiguity
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** One of the most important things in technical writing is to make sure the information that you write is very clear. Use the following rules to help avoid confusion:

        -   Always proofread your writing carefully to identify possible ambiguity.
        -   It is also always a good idea to have someone else proofread your writing because it may seem clear to you, but if it is ambiguous to them, in any way, then it is probably also ambiguous to your normal audience.
        -   Be careful when using pronouns \(*"this*, *"these"*, *"it"*\). Always ask yourself if there is any chance that the reader will not know exactly what items the pronouns are referencing. See the [*Vague Pronouns* section](#vague-pronouns-dlentry) in the Grammar Rules for more specific information.

    Audience
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Always consider who your audience might be for your specific topic. Once you identify who you are writing it for, ask yourself what they need to know and make sure you include everything that audience needs to know.

    Avoid *Fancy* Words
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** The best writing is simple and concise, with the relevant ideas delivered in a clear and direct manner. Avoid using *fancy* words that might be perceived as pretentious or more elaborate than necessary. Your audience will appreciate reading words that are simple and to the point. They care about your content being clear and accurate, not how big your vocabulary is.

    Avoid Passive Voice
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Particularly in technical writing, you should avoid using a passive voice whenever possible. Passive writing comes across as sounding weak and ambiguous, while using in an active voice makes your writing seem more alive and clear. Basically, passive voice happens when the object of a sentence is placed in the beginning of a sentence instead of the end. In other words, the object becomes the subject. For example, *"I mailed the letter"* becomes passive if it is changed to *"The letter was mailed by me"*.

        How to recognize a *Passive Voice* sentence
        :   The two most basic things to ask yourself are:

            -   Is the object in the subject position?
            -   Can I add *"by \[so-and-so\]"* to the end?

        :   Also, keep this in mind: All passive sentences include a form of the verb *"to be"* \(such as *"was"*, *"were"* or *"is"*\), BUT not all sentences that have those verbs are passive. It is easy to recognize sentences that include a form of *"to be"* but you need to ask yourself the two questions above to determine if it is in the passive voice.

        **_Examples from the UG:_**
        :   **Passive voice:** *The New Document wizard allows you to select custom templates that __were created in previous sessions by you or other users__.* \[INCORRECT\]

        :   **Active voice:** *The New Document wizard allows you to select custom templates that __you or other users created in previous sessions__.* \[CORRECT\]

    Avoid Using Figures of Speech
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Always avoid figures of speech, such as similes and metaphors.

    Consistency
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** By nature, technical documentation is certainly not much fun to read and it might seem that meticulous consistency would make it even more boring. That logic might true for general writing, but most of the time the only reason why people read technical documentation is because they are stuck and need to figure out how to do something specific. Using meticulous consistency in technical writing will allow the user to find information quickly and help them to understand it better.

    Contractions
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Contractions are appropriate only for conversational use and for informal writing, but never for technical writing. Avoid using them in the User Guide.

    Include Links to Other Documentation
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Include links to other pertinent sections of the documentation \(or other resources\) whenever possible. You want to make it as convenient as possible for the users to navigate to other sections, topics, or resources that might help them to find the information they need.

    Make Important Content Noticeable
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Use various structural elements to make topics more visually appealing and readable. It is a good practice to break up long blocks of text with some sort of contrast. Use titles, lists or notes to create contrast and emphasize important informations, and always use concrete language.

    Markup
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** People read technical documentation differently than they do other types of writing. They tend to skim through documentation to quickly find the information they need. This means good technical documentation needs to have a lot of structured markup to emphasize content and point the reader directly to information they need for the specific subject. Also, use a variety of structural elements to emphasize and break up blocks of content.

    Sections
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Use sections to separate multiple subjects in the same topic, to create breaks in long blocks of text, and to introduce procedures. The basic idea of using sections is to allow users to quickly find the specific part of the topic that contains the information they are looking for, without needing to read other content that may not be relevant to their specific need. Each section should contain a good title that describes the content of that section. This will also help readers find specific information more quickly.

    Short Sentences and Paragraphs
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** You should try to keep sentences short because they are easier to read and understand. Each sentence should have one basic thought. More than that creates complexity and invites confusion. Likewise, paragraphs should also as short as possible because our brains take in information better when it is broken into small chunks. Also, all the sentences in each paragraph should be interconnected to a single idea.

    Teach
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Good technical documentation should be focused on teaching or guiding the audience, rather than simply providing arbitrary information. The purpose of technical documentation is to teach a new user to become of expert and then support them once they are.

    Use Structure for Procedural or Task-Related Information
    :   **Rules or Suggestions:** Do not bury task-related information within dense paragraphs. This will make your readers very frustrated when they are trying to learn how to do a specific task. Use structured components to make your instructions more visible and appealing. Follow the subsequent guidelines whenever documenting procedures.

    :   **Guidelines for documenting procedures:**

        -   It is helpful to use titles for procedures, especially when the procedure is surrounded by a large amount of content. This helps the reader to quickly find the procedure that they are looking for amongst blocks of other content.
        -   Only use unordered lists \(`ul`\) when steps do not need to occur in sequence.
        -   Always use ordered lists \(`ol`\) when the steps must occur in a sequence and make sure the items are in proper order.
        -   Each step in a procedure should be an action in the sequence.
        -   If possible, eliminate steps that lack action. Instead, put informational content after the action within a step, or put it outside the step \(for example, in a `paragraph` or `step result`\).
        -   Use sub-steps rather than putting too many tasks within one step.
        -   Clearly identify optional steps. For example, put the word *"optional"* in parentheses at the beginning of the step.
        -   Identify conditional steps with words such as *"if"* and *"then"*.
        -   Use an additional list within a list for branching steps, such as alternative methods.
        -   Edit and rewrite ambiguous steps. Proofread the entire procedure, or better yet, have someone else read the procedure, and if there is any ambiguity in any of the steps, the procedure needs to be revised.
