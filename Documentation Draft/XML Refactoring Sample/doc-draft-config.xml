    <draft-summary>The XML Refactoring tool in Oxygen XML Editor (available in the Tools menu) helps
      manage the structure of XML documents by allowing users to perform various structure
      management tasks such as inserting, deleting, or renaming attributes in all instances of a
      particular element. The tool is presented as a wizard with multiple pages, including options
      to configure operation parameters and select the scope and filters for the operation. Users
      can preview the changes before applying them, but there is no automatic way to revert the
      operations once they are finished. Additionally, the tool cannot preserve CDATA sections in
      the XML documents.</draft-summary>
    <instruction>Add each image in the documentation and present the flow of the operation as
      suggested by these images. Add them in the correct order of the steps. You should document
      each UI element shown in the images.</instruction>
